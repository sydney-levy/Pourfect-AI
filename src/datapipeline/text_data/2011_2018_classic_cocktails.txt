Welcome!
Tammy’s Tastings is an Ann Arbor, MI based company that creates unique food and drink
experiences, ranging from tasting events, to private bartending and personal chef services, to
cooking classes and workshops. Since 2011 I have been teaching regular cocktail classes to
home bar enthusiasts both in public classes in southeast Michigan and northwest Ohio as well
as private in-home classes throughout the area. You can learn more about me at
tammystastings.com.
This cocktail recipe book collects almost all1
 of the drinks taught in over 7 years of public
classes. Some of the recipes are ones I created. The majority are sourced from cocktail books,
the Internet, and conversations with bartenders throughout the country and the world. With
over 450 unique recipes, there’s bound to be something here that you like – and probably quite
a few that you won’t too! New recipes in this edition are marked in the alphabetical index at
the end of the book.
Recipe are mostly organized by their base spirit, but if you’re looking for a particular recipe,
there is an alphabetical index of recipe names at the end of the book. The Other Base Spirits
section includes drinks that use non-traditional base spirits, like amari, cordials/liqueurs,
vermouth, sherry and port, as well as drinks featuring wine or champagne without any base
spirit modifiers. This year I added three new chapters. Two of them – Drinks Served Hot and
Punches & Nog – are pretty self-explanatory! The third is a bit more eclectic. In each year’s
Farm-to-Glass cocktails class we make a drink featuring a new vegetable. Many of these require
odd specialty syrups or ingredients that won’t ever get used in any other drink. So I’ve
separated those out into The Annual Weird Vegetable Cocktails chapter. Other farm-to-glass
cocktails featuring cucumbers, berries, herbs and more remain in the regular listings.
Speaking of ingredients, many of the recipes call for house made syrups, shrubs and other
items. Recipes for all of those can be found in the ingredients section, which is organized into
four parts. When a number in brackets follows an ingredient (like “grenadine [2]”) it’s a pointer
to a numbered part of the ingredient section which begins on page 63.
Happy mixing!

Cherries
Bright red maraschino cherries can be nice on an
ice cream sundae, but please do not use them for
your cocktails. The Luxardo-branded cherries in
heavy syrup are delicious (and the bar standard
worldwide), so look for a jar. Or make your own!
1 cup sugar
2 whole cloves
1 cinnamon stick
4 cardamom pods
1 quart cherries, stemmed and pitted
1/2 cup brandy
In a small saucepan, combine sugar and spices with
a cup of water. Bring to a simmer, stirring until
sugar dissolves. Let simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off
heat and add cherries and brandy to pot. Let cool,
then store mixture in a jar in refrigerator for at
least 2 days before eating, and up to several
months.
Don’s Gardenia Mix
Using a spatula or an electric kitchen mixer, cream
1 oz of honey with 1 oz of softened, unsalted
butter; add 1 tsp of cinnamon syrup, 1/2 tsp of
vanilla syrup [2] and 1/2 tsp of allspice liqueur.
Refrigerate the remainder for up to 1 week.
