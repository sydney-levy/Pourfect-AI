A purposeful introduction
This is a recipe book of non-alcoholic drinks: ‘mock cocktails’, or as they are more
commonly known, ‘Mocktails’.
Mocktails + Mastery, however, is not your standard recipe book.
This is a book that intends to challenge Australian drinking culture. It intends to give
permission to the people who choose not to drink to stand by their choices; it intends
to offer a helping hand to the people who would like to change their drinking habits;
and it intends to extend an invitation to the people who are happy with their drinking
habits but who want to share enriched experiences with loved ones who don’t drink.
Drinking culture in Australia is known to be harmful to the health and wellbeing of the
people within it, and this book is one little boat in a sea of many other interventions
that are intent on trying to correct the issue.
This book views alcohol and drinking culture through an evolutionary biology lens,
looking into why humans do the things they do and how they can reach the same goals
of pleasure, relaxation and connection in safe and healthy ways. The book tries not
to make any assumptions about the reader and gives practical knowledge alongside
information and theory.
This book is delivered in three sections: The Mocktails, with drink recipes and
information; The Handmade Ingredients, with recipes for syrups and other additions;
The Details, with information about safe ingredients for people taking medications,
cooking and measurement terms and types of drinkware. Finally, there is space in the
back of the book for your own recipes.
Mocktails + Mastery is written to hand the wheel to the reader, to give them the
knowledge they need to be the masters of their own lives... and to hand them
something to drink while they’re at it.
Cheers!

Put off today what you can do tomorrow
The majority of people in the world will be curious about drugs in their lifetime. Human
beings are naturally curious, and love to learn and experience new things.
Using drugs (including alcohol) can have a positive effect, making you feel good. If they
didn’t, people probably wouldn’t use them! Someone might use a drug many times
without any obvious problems, but any drug can be harmful. Some people might use a
drug only once and experience accidents or problems.
Just like medicines, drugs should be used carefully if they are used at all. Like medicines,
some drugs aren’t safe to use below a certain age. Young bodies and brains, especially
those under 25 years, are more vulnerable to damage and negative effects.
Young bodies are still growing and developing. It is harder for a young body to defend
itself against problems that an adult body finds easy to fix. Growing is an important and
complex process, and drugs can interrupt and change how it happens.
Many people will choose to use alcohol or other drugs in their lifetime. Some only
experiment, and others will find their use enjoyable and keep doing it.
In either case, it’s important to delay the use of alcohol and other drugs as long as
possible.
Once someone is around 25 years old their body and brain have reached maturity.
Mature bodies are better protected against harm.
Avoiding all drug use as long as possible gives the body the best chance to grow and
develop the way it is meant to.
◊	 Even if a substance has a positive effect, it can still do harm to you and your body
◊	 Most people will be curious about substances in their lifetime
◊	 Just like medicines, sometimes substances aren’t safe to use under a certain age
◊	 Avoiding substances for as long as possible gives your body the best environment
to develop

Belonging
You feel comfortable, like you can be yourself… and welcome, like the others would always be
glad to see you.
This complicated feeling is called ‘belonging’, and it is when you feel connected to
and included in a group of people. For humans, where we belong affects our sense of
identity. Belonging with a group changes how we feel about ourselves.
For many people the first place they feel they belong is with their families, but this is
never the only option. Sporting clubs, schools, workplaces, fandoms… it doesn’t matter
where if you feel you belong there.
Belonging is one of many protective factors against alcohol and other drug misuse.
This means that people who feel they belong with a group are more protected against
negative outcomes from using alcohol and other drugs. Sometimes, people use alcohol
and drugs to fit in with a group. You can avoid these things and still belong: there are
many ways to fit in.
The places that people belong to can change over time. It’s normal to find yourself
moving between groups as your life changes. It’s also healthy to move away from a
group if your needs, desires, and values no longer match up.
There can be periods of time where you feel like you’re not part of any group. This can
happen during times of great change, such as changing clubs or moving far away, or
they may happen as people grow older and their lives change. These periods are normal,
and there are always new groups to find and join. During these times, it is wise to take
extra care when using drugs and alcohol.
Everybody can find a place to belong, even if it means starting a group themselves.
Perhaps you could start with a mocktail mixing club…?

Alcohol and feeling fine
Drinking alcohol does a bunch of things to your body, and we find many of them
desirable. We experience physical effects like a slower heart rate and relaxation, and
mental effects such as feeling happy and confident. Drinking alcohol releases certain
chemicals in the brain that feel like a reward, making you feel good when you drink and
encouraging you to drink again.
How good you feel after drinking alcohol, however, might depend more on how you
believe you will feel. Some studies suggest that how you expect to feel has a bigger
impact than how much you actually drink. In experiments where a person thinks they
are drinking alcohol, they begin to act and feel like they are drunk… even if they were
given a drink without any alcohol at all. People who expected to have fun and feel
good often felt that way, with or without alcohol. There are real changes happening in
the brain, but the cause might not be the drink itself! There is even evidence that this
placebo-like effect works even when you know about it.
You can enjoy the fun and feelings of alcohol without drinking a drop. But whether you
choose to drink or not, you can influence how you feel and if you enjoy yourself:
• Tell yourself that you’re going to have a great time
• Eat and drink some good tasting things
• Do activities you enjoy and find fun
• Make plans to stay safe and comfortable
Take some action and your brain will start mixing up the chemicals to fill in the rest!
◊	 A large portion of alcohol’s effects may be due to expectations
◊	 If we expect something to happen, our brains can trick us into feeling like it did
◊	 If drinking makes you feel confident, happy and outgoing, you can feel like that
without drinking

Take a sip
Human bodies are made up of about 45% to 75% water. It’s used for many things,
like moving nutrients around and balancing body temperature. Considering it’s such a
huge part of our bodies, hydration is important. It’s necessary to take in enough water
to replace what you use and lose, and how much you need to drink is unique to you.
Our bodies lose up to 2 litres of water every day, from general body functions and from
things like sweating and using the toilet. Feeling thirsty is your body saying that you
need to drink. Thirst means that you might be a little dehydrated.
Dehydration is when your body doesn’t have enough water to do everything it needs to
do. Mild dehydration can cause headaches, dry lips, mood changes, and make you feel
tired and weak. Severe dehydration can be much more dangerous and may be caused by
vomiting or diarrhoea. (If you think someone is dangerously dehydrated, give them clean
water to sip on and take them to the doctor immediately.)
Older people have less water in their bodies, and may not feel thirsty even when they
need to drink. It’s important for older people to drink small amounts regularly. Some
medicines, and substances such as alcohol and caffeine, can cause your body to lose
water faster. If this happens, it’s important to increase your water intake. It can help to
drink a glass of water between every drink of alcohol or caffeine.
Drinking isn’t always easy, especially if you’re feeling unwell. Drinks that are tasty, cool,
and have a little salt may be easier to drink if you’re not feeling well. Sports drinks and
plain tasting mocktails can be helpful for people recovering from mild dehydration.
You can also purchase ‘oral rehydration solutions’, like Hydralyte, from your local
pharmacy, or mix a simple one at home: 6 level teaspoons of sugar and a ½ level
teaspoon of salt dissolved in 1 litre of water.
Learn about Oral Rehydration Solutions at: rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm

Cheers to the big win!
Take a moment to think about sports.
A lot of things probably come to mind: Footballs, uniforms and teams; Getting up early
for practice; Big games in giant stadiums; Finals celebrated with barbequed foods eaten
around a giant TV; and, probably, things like a funny ad for a branded beer, a frothing
dew-kissed glass, or pulling a can from a slab.
For better or worse, alcohol is a huge part of our sporting culture. While there’s nothing
wrong with enjoying a beer on a hot summer day while cheering for your favourite team,
making a habit of always pairing alcohol and sport can lead to some problems.
Sporting is all about enjoying what the human body can do, and the thrill of friendly
competition. It’s natural to celebrate a big win or commiserate a pounding loss; and in
both cases, it’s common to reach for a glass.
Players who drink after a game can find themselves dealing with some risks. Alcohol
mixed with physical activity can cause dehydration and other negative effects on
performance and recovery. The effect alcohol has on balance and decision making can
lead to accidents and injuries… neither of which are helpful for winning the next match,
nor much fun for the spectators. Adults who are in the habit of drinking alcohol while
watching a sport can, without meaning to, pass on the message to children that these
things always go together. Children whose parents drink regularly are more likely to
want to drink alcohol, and more likely to do so.
Finding ways to celebrate without drinking can be enjoyable, cheaper and safer. Alcoholfree celebrations also include everyone; especially young people, who should be able to
enjoy every part of sport!
◊	 Sporting is all about enjoying what your body can do and friendly competition
◊	 Alcohol after a sporting event can cause dehydration, accidents and injuries
◊	 Celebrating sporting events without alcohol models healthy behaviours for kids

A new baby!
A baby is coming! Aside from weddings (and maybe your favourite team winning a big
game), pregnancies can be the life event with the most celebrations attached. There are
announcements, baby showers, naming days, and the celebration of the birth itself…
not to mention all the ‘firsts’ and new birthdays!
In many cultures, celebrations include alcohol… and sometimes, lots of it! Champagne
and other types of wine are often used to toast the person for whom the celebration is
being held, and alcohol filled celebrations are common in movies and other media.
Celebrations around a pregnancy aren’t always the best place for alcohol, however. For
people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, not drinking until their baby is weaned is the
safest option. This means that for many of these celebrations, the expectant parent is
often left out when they should be feeling the most included.
Having these types of celebrations without alcohol means that everyone can be
included: not just the pregnant parent to be, but family members who can’t drink, and
also young children (who might be more excited than anyone!).
There is something wonderful about having a special drink for a special occasion – after
all, it’s hard to make a traditional toast without a glass in your hand. That said, special
drinks can easily be non-alcoholic: Mocktails to the rescue!
Why not try the Mock Champagne recipe on page 53 for a bubbly everyone can love,
or take a peek at the Fancymaking ideas on page 82 to theme your drinks to your big
event?

Party hard, party safe
Getting together with friends, family, acquaintances, and even complete strangers can
be incredibly fun! But accidents happen, and they tend to happen more often when you
have lots of people in one place.
Other factors also affect how likely accidents are. We can think of the brain as having
two parts: the cortex, or the big brain, which is in control of decision making, thinking,
planning, and caution. The subcortex, or the little brain, is in control of your body,
instinct, and the ‘fight, flight or flee’ response when danger appears.
If someone is intoxicated, or feeling very strong emotions, the little brain can take over:
it’s much harder to think rationally, make good decisions, and move with the usual
accuracy and grace.
Whether your party has alcohol or not, good planning can make your gatherings safer,
leaving more time and energy for enjoying yourself.
Removing potential obstacles and having a quiet place for rest can help if a guest’s little
brain takes over.
Slowing down intoxication by providing plenty of food and alcohol alternatives like
water and mocktails can make sure that everyone is partying with their big brain and
having a good time.
The Party Rules booklet contains many extra tips and tricks for planning safe parties for
young people. You can download or request a copy at www.den.org.au/resources.
◊	 Accidents can happen in any group gathering
◊	 If people are intoxicated, accidents are more likely
◊	 Serving mocktails between alcoholic drinks makes sure everyone is safe and
hydrated

4. Some ingredients (like Mint, Basil, and
Berries) should be gently crushed.
5. Once all your ingredients are prepared,
simply fill your jug or water bottle with water.
Place the ingredients inside, and leave in the
fridge to infuse for at least 1 hour. For the
best flavour, leave your infusion to steep

The science of taste and the brain
Dopamine is a natural brain chemical. It has many jobs, but it is best known for being
a very important part of the reward system: the system that makes you feel good when
you’re seeking something, or when you’ve achieved a goal. Although brain chemistry
is very complicated, we can simplify it. Usually when dopamine levels are high you feel
good. When they’re too low, you feel bad. Our brains release dopamine to encourage us
to do things again.
Many things increase the level of dopamine in your brain, including eating foods you
find tasty. Foods that taste good to us are usually full of nutrients and energy, in the
form of fat and carbohydrates. When food is scarce and we don’t know where our next
meal is coming from, our brains know to look for high energy foods: so that we can store
the extra energy in case we can’t find more.
This is why a cupcake or slice of pizza tastes so good: these foods are full to the brim
with energy! Brains encouraging us to eat these foods helps to keep us alive when times
are hard. Human brains evolved to seek these foods a long time ago, when food was
hard to find. Many people can now obtain food easily, but our brains still want to seek
rich foods, just in case.
People make food choices for many reasons. Keeping a balance of high and low energy
foods is a good idea. It’s important to avoid thinking that any food that tastes good
(and so is high in energy) is bad for you. They’re just not meant to be eaten every day.
According to the hierarchy of food needs, ‘good tasting’ food is more important than
‘instrumental food’ (which is food you eat because of the health effects). If you don’t
have enough food that tastes good to you, you’ll be less able to make food decisions in
a healthy way. Having access to tasty food is important to your health, so have one tasty
something every day!
◊	 Foods that taste good increase dopamine levels
◊	 Our bodies evolved to like certain tastes because they give us energy to live
◊	 Having access to good tasting things is important for health

Caring
Watching someone you care about go through a rough time can be really upsetting
and difficult. It can feel like you’d rather go through the problem yourself instead of
watching them struggle… and if you can’t solve the problem, it can be hard to figure out
how to help. But small gestures can make a big difference. There are lots of things you
can do to make rough times easier on you and the people you love.
It’s tempting to say, “Call me if you need anything”, but when someone is dealing with
problems, hearing that can feel overwhelming. They might know they need something,
but not what it is… or they might not know what you mean by “anything”! It’s easier to
accept help when the uncertainty is removed.
When you’re offering help, be specific. Only offer what you are able and want to do, and
be clear about what you can and can’t do. If you want to help with getting necessary
things done, offer help with specific tasks, like offering to go buy groceries together. If
you want to help your loved one relax and take care of themselves, offer to spend time
with them to do that. Be realistic about how you can help, and make sure to take care
of yourself too.
Having caring relationships is one of many alcohol and other drug (AOD) protective factors.
This means that people who have them are more protected from negative outcomes if
they happen to use alcohol or other drugs.
Even when you can’t spare the time or energy to do something specific, it’s always
helpful to remind people that they are cared about.
You don’t have to solve someone’s problems to help them or show you care. It can be as
easy as sending a cheerful ‘good morning’ text or making them a mocktail at the end of
a long day. Sometimes, the mocktail means ‘I love you’.
◊	 Offering to do things for and with that person is a great way to help
◊	 Having caring relationships is a protective factor against a lot of things
◊	 You can say ‘I love you’ with more than just words

Role modelling
Babies and children are incredible learning machines. From the moment they pop into
the world, they are constantly learning. Their brains are busy growing and developing to
store and organise all of this important information.
Babies and children look to their parents as their guide to the world. They watch how
their parent moves, how they sound and look, and will copy them to learn how to act
and be.
Preparing to live in a social world, children learn a lot by watching, listening, and copying
their parents. This means that if you say one thing and do another (like if you tell your
child to put their dirty socks in the basket, but yours are always on the floor), the child
might just copy what you’re doing, even if they’re trying really hard to do what you say.
Children pick up on behaviours and attitudes about everything, and alcohol and other
drug use is no exception: children with parents who drink regularly are much more likely
to drink themselves.
The best way to help children develop a healthy attitude and understanding is to model
the behaviour you want them to have: Do what you want them to do!
If you model safe and responsible use of alcohol and other drugs, your children will
grow up thinking, “This is just how it’s always done”, and are more likely to follow these
behaviours into adulthood.
Some of the behaviours you might want to model could be:
◊	 Sticking to the Australian safe use of alcohol guidelines
	 		 www.nhmrc.gov.au/health-topics/alcohol-guidelines
◊	 Celebrating some special occasions without alcohol
◊	 Making plans to get home safely if you’re going out to drink
◊	 Having an alcohol free day at least once a week
◊	 Enjoying some meals without an alcoholic drink

Reaching for that natural high
Feeling good has everything to do with your happy chemicals: natural chemicals used by
the brain. There are many of these, but some of the most important ones are dopamine,
serotonin, and oxytocin.
These chemicals are released in response to stimuli, or particular events that the brain
notices. The amount released, and which part of the brain receives them, changes how
you feel and behave. Your brain uses these chemicals to help you cope with outcomes
and to encourage you… either to keep doing something healthy, or to stop doing
something unhealthy. When you do something that is good for you, like eating an
energy-rich food or spending time with a loved one, your brain wants to make sure you
keep doing it: It releases some happy chemicals to reward you, and to make you want to
do that thing again!
The pleasant feelings that come from using drugs happen because of two main reasons.
The chemicals inside the drug can bind to the parts of your brain that absorb and use
your regular happy chemicals. Or, the drug can trigger your brain into releasing happy
chemicals without the normal cause.
Feelings from drug use can be much stronger and more intense than is usually felt
without them. This can come at the cost of temporarily depleting your brain’s supply of
happy chemicals. Without the normal amount of happy chemicals, you can feel tired,
sad, or angry after the high has gone away. Highs from happy chemicals without drug
use don’t usually have this effect, and those natural highs are important for your overall
health. They could even help you recover faster from illness.
Use your happy chemicals by doing things you enjoy, eating good food, exercising and
spending time with loved ones. Your brain and your body are completely connected: if
you take care of one, you’re taking care of both.
◊	 Good feelings come from natural chemicals inside the brain
◊	 The same feelings from substances can be created in other ways

Permission to play
You’ve seen your family pet run through the house at top speed for no reason. You’ve
watched countless YouTube cats chase their tails until they fall over. Animals, whether
they’re babies or adults, love to play.
All kinds of animals have been seen to play when they’re fully grown, even animals you’d
least expect: some types of bird seem to slide down hills for fun, and crocodiles give
adorable piggyback rides! Many humans play as adults, because we’re animals, too.
While we don’t really know why animals play, studies suggest that play is important
for the brain. In some research, animals that had many chances to play were smarter
than animals who couldn’t play very often. We also know that playing makes animals
happier.
When human people reach adulthood they sometimes begin to feel like they’re not
allowed to play. It might be seen as ‘too childish’, or that the only adult ways to have fun
involve things that children aren’t allowed to do. Not being allowed to play isn’t good
for other animals, and it isn’t good for humans either.
Even if it seems like adults should be serious, there is nothing childish about playing.
After all, we know that adults in other species play, so we should be no exception. It’s
important for our health to have fun and enjoy ourselves!
So even if you really do enjoy more ‘grown up’ activities, think about making some time
to play. Go out and throw a ball, try a round of chess, chase an imaginary tail, bust out a
board game with friends, and go play!
◊	 All kinds of animals play, even when they are adults
◊	 Studies suggest playing is important for your brain

Being a boozeless social butterfly
We all know the story: a person walks into a party worried and shy and, with the magic
of alcohol, becomes a sparkling social butterfly. Most of the social effects of alcohol,
like being confident and talkative, aren’t actually caused by the alcohol itself: instead,
those effects are mostly caused by the expectation that we’ll feel that way.
Alcohol really does have an effect on people: ethanol (that’s the other name for alcohol)
has measurable effects on our bodies. But the positive feelings we look for from alcohol
can be (and frequently are!) made by the brain, all by itself.
Because all emotions are made by chemical changes, and the brain regulates these
changes all the time, we can influence how we feel… and help our brain create the
feelings we want. So, how do we gently push our feelings in the right direction?
If you’re feeling nervous, focussing on an activity helps direct your brain away from
the thing worrying you. Dancing, singing, handing out snacks… whatever you feel
comfortable with.
Just holding a glass in your hand could be a surprisingly big part of the comfort alcohol
can bring. It gives you something to do with your hands, keeps your body language
open, and matches the body language of other people. It could give your brain a cue
that says “Party time! This is gonna be great!”.
Holding a ‘Power Pose’ for two minutes is proven to help you feel confident. (Find a
private spot to sit or stand, and pose like a superhero… or the CEO of a multibillion
dollar company.)
Our brains keep a very close watch on body language – others, and our own. We can
help ourselves feel a certain way by posing our body: the more open, relaxed and strong
our body language is, the better we feel.
‘Fake it until you make it’ is cliché, but true. Act how you want to feel: your brain will
follow your lead!
◊	 Most of the social effects from drinking come from us expecting this to happen
◊	 You can make your brain create the same feelings

The developing brain
The brain is one of the most important organs in our body. It controls how our bodies
work, letting us move, speak, think, and act. It begins growing before we are born and
continues to change as long as we live.
The brain doesn’t grow and change all at once. Some parts finish growing when we are
very young, while other parts take much longer. Studies suggest that our brains don’t
finish developing to maturity until we are around 25 years old. Even when the brain is
mature, it continues to change as we experience life.
While developing, our brains are busy making huge changes to how they are arranged
and how they work. There are many stages of development for each part of the brain.
There are changes to things like the ‘padding’ around neurons to help them send signals,
how many connections are active between brain areas, and which connections are
stronger and most used.
People younger than 25 can seem very different to people who are older, and they can
have difficulty with things that adults take for granted. This happens partially because a
major part of the brain, called the prefrontal cortex, hasn’t finished developing yet. The
prefrontal cortex is found just behind the eyes and is important for many things, such
as attention, planning, decision making, impulse control, and logical thinking. Until it is
fully grown, a young person can’t do these things as well as an older adult can.
While the brain is developing, it’s doing many important things at once. It needs to be
protected from things that might harm it, and encouraged to grow. This is why many
guidelines recommend avoiding alcohol and other drugs as long as possible: these
substances can interrupt the normal growing process.
Delaying alcohol uptake is one way to help a developing brain grow the way it should –
replacing alcohol with mocktails is a great place to start.
◊	 Brain development is finished at around 25 years.
◊	 Young people have trouble with some things because their brain hasn’t finished
growing yet.

Mixing medications (...with alcohol)
Many, many people will need at least one medicine in their lifetime. It’s important
to know that medicines and alcohol can work against one another in the body. This
can happen with over-the-counter medicine, a homeopathic remedy, or prescribed
medication.
Less than one standard drink mixed with medicine can have a big effect. Drinking
alcohol when you’re taking a medicine could make that medicine less effective. It could
also cause uncomfortable or dangerous symptoms.
If you’re using a medicine, it’s important to check if alcohol is safe to drink on the days
that you take it. Even medicines that don’t seem likely can mix badly with alcohol.
Laxatives, herbal remedies and more can react with alcohol. Those reactions can cause
symptoms such as headaches, confusion, and drowsiness.
If you’re not sure if it is safe to drink while taking a medicine, a pharmacist can answer
any questions. All prescribed medicines have an information leaflet that you can
download or receive at a pharmacy.
You can check websites like NPS Medicinewise (www.nps.org.au) for medicine
information and interactions with alcohol.
Whether you’re using a medicine for a short or long time, replacing alcohol with a
mocktail is safer. Having something tasty to drink can help you feel better if you’re sick
and can help lift your mood by releasing dopamine.
It’s not all negative! Good tasting food and drink increase the level of happy chemicals in
your brain. Take a look at page 34 for information about the science of taste.
You can also get some of the enjoyable effects of alcohol without drinking a thing. Look
at page 46 to find out about natural highs.
◊	 If you are taking a medicine, it is important to check that it is safe to drink
alcohol, and how much.
◊	 Mocktails can be part of a solution

Here’s to a healthy pregnancy
Pregnancy can be full of joy and excitement. Even if everyone is happy for a new baby to
join the family, pregnancy itself can be a difficult experience.
Pregnant people have a lot going on inside their bodies; after all, they’re busy helping a
new human grow. This can leave them tired, sore, and with lots of strong emotions.
Families often become extra busy during a pregnancy: buying nappies and clothes,
setting up changing tables and cots, trying to prepare for a big change to their lifestyle.
Part of adjusting to this new lifestyle, during pregnancy and after, might be changing
drinking behaviour. Because unborn babies and young children are still developing,
alcohol is dangerous to them. There isn’t a safe level of alcohol consumption during
pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
This means that a pregnant person might need to stop drinking for more than a year…
which can be sad and frustrating, just like giving up any enjoyable activity.
With all these changes going on, and possibly having to give up some things that make
the day nicer, pregnant people can use some extra support, love and care. Spending
time with them and helping with everyday tasks can make a joyous but difficult time a
little easier.
Sharing good food, good times (and good mocktails!) instead of sharing alcohol lends
your favourite pregnant person something to lean on when things get a little annoying…
and they help everyone feel loved and included.
◊	 Even if pregnancy is joyous, it can be difficult
◊	 If the pregnant person enjoys drinking, it can be sad or frustrating to stop
◊	 Sharing non-alcoholic drinks and good times can make it a little easier

Shaking drinks is a way to mix ingredients, aerate and rapidly cool down a beverage and strain any
solids. If you can’t find a drink shaker to use, try these easy alternatives!
SHAKE IT
1. Put all of your ingredients into
the Bigger cup.
2. Put the Smaller cup, upside-down,
inside the Bigger cup, pressing down
gently to create a seal.
3. Hold the two cups firmly together
and shake!
4. To strain, tilt the Smaller cup very
slightly to create a small gap, and pour.

Safety and Ingredients
Just like any food, some mocktail ingredients might not be safe for everyone. Some
people may have allergies or be unable to eat certain foods. It is important to check your
medicines, as some foods change how they work (see page 58 for more information).
If you are unsure if a guest needs to avoid an ingredient, the best way to find out is to
ask! Most people with food requirements will know what they can safely eat. You could
also make an ingredient card for your mocktails, so that people can decide quietly for
themselves.
Below is a list of some ingredients that might not be safe for everyone.
Blue Green Algae (Spirulina) | May interact with immunosuppressant medications. May be
unsafe for auto-immune diseases. Unknown safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Cranberry | Interacts with Warfarin. May interact with medicines changed by the liver. May be
unsafe for people with aspirin allergies.
Culinary Lavender | Interacts with sedatives and CNS depressants. May interact with drugs
used in surgery.
Food Colouring | Some people may have allergies to certain types of food colouring.
Ginger | Interacts with medicines that slow blood clotting. May interact with diabetes and
high blood pressure medicines.
Grapefruit | Interacts strongly with a variety of medicines including birth control.
Honey | Not recommended for children under 1 year old due to the risk of botulism infection.
Nutmeg | Can interact with multiple medicines, especially medicines changed by the liver.
Pomegranate | Interacts with medicines changed by the liver. Can interact with blood
pressure medicines.
Rhubarb | Interacts with many medicines, including laxatives. Interacts with medicines which
harm the kidneys, including NSAIDS such as Ibuprofen.

Choosing your Drinkware
Mocktails are delicious no matter how you drink them. Adding in the right drinkware,
however, can take a mocktail experience from ‘average’ to ‘excellent’! When choosing
drinkware, the size, shape and colour can make a difference. It’s also surprisingly
important to consider what your drinkware is made of. There’s no right answer to
choosing drinkware, but there are some things to consider:
Who will use the drinkware?
Safer options might be better if your guests might drop a glass.
How many people will need drinkware?
If you have many people, simple drinkware is easy to stack and hold.
How much time do you want to spend cleaning up?
Disposable and recyclable options can be worthwhile for saving time.
There are three main materials that drinkware is made from, each with strengths and
weaknesses.
GLASS | Easy to clean and hygienic, but dangerous when dropped. Glass drinkware
can be found in every shape, colour, and size. Glass drinkware can be etched and
engraved for special occasions.
ACRYLIC | Scratches easily making it harder to clean, but usually safe when dropped.
Often dishwasher safe. Available in a wide variety of colours and shapes.
PLASTIC | Often disposable. Soft plastics are very safe, while hard brittle plastics
can shatter when dropped. They come in limited colours and shapes, but are perfect to
customise as keepsakes.
80
Types of Drinkware
Tea or Coffee cup | 200 to 300 mL | A small, usually
ceramic cup that may be used in Cafes. Good for semiformal
gatherings.
Mug | 350 mL to 450 mL | An informal cup, usually ceramic.
Perfect for warm drinks, cosy settings and good company.
Champagne Flute | 200 mL | An elegant looking glass,
perfect for drinks with bubbles.
Highball Glass | 350 to 400 mL | Easy to hold and excellent
for light tasting drinks. These are sometimes called Tumblers.
Lowball Glass | 250 to 300 mL | Great for strong tasting or
very sugary drinks.
Wine Glass | 250 to 300 mL | A pretty glass that is easy to
hold and lovely for quiet events.
Margarita Glass | 250 mL | Lovely for bright or creamy
drinks, with a large rim for sugar and salt garnish.
81
Martini Glass | 250 mL | A classic glass that looks lovely for
transparent drinks, but it easily topples over.
Shot Glass | 25 to 50 mL | A tiny glass, perfect for tasters!
Port or Sherry Glass | 200 mL | Smaller versions of Wine
glasses, they are lovely for quieter events.
Beer Glass | 400 mL | A very large glass similar to a Highball,
easy to hold and great for light tasting drinks.
Stein Glass | 500 mL | Equipped with a handle for easy grip,
this glass is perfect for warm and mulled drinks.
Hurricane Glass | 300 mL | A tall and slightly fancier
alternative to a Highball glass, this is perfect for bright and swirly
drinks.
Mason Jar | 470 mL | Slowly coming into popularity in
Australia, this glass is highly customisable and great for informal
parties or to add a rustic look.
Novelty Drinkware | Any Size | Endless shapes and sizes!
Many stores stock various drinkware that suits any mood or theme.

Fancymaking: The Drinkware
Making mocktails? Let’s make them fancy. There are quite literally ENDLESS possibilities
for making your mocktails as delighful as possible: here are a few ideas!
For more inspiration and instruction, check out our Mocktails board on Pinterest:
www.pinterest.com/drugedtas/mocktails
Decorative Edging: For a burst of flavour while you sip, wet the rim of your glass in
water, syrup, juice or melted chocolate and then dip in some sanding sugar, salt, or
crushed candy. You could also try crushed biscuits, popping candy, or sprinkles.
Straws, Swizzles and Stirrers: These functional decorations come in an endless
collection of colours, sizes, and shapes, and if that isn’t enough you can also customise
them! Stick berries on the end of a swizzle stick for a snack, add some paper cut outs
to a straw to give your guest a moustache while they drink, or perhaps dip a spoon into
melted chocolate to stir into a milky mocktail.
Drink Charms: If you have a lot of identical cups, you want to make sure your guests
can keep track of which glass belongs to them. Drink charms to the rescue: Add a
purchased charm to a wine glass, or make your own using a disc of paper or other craft
supplies: They’re easy to make and to customise to a theme, or to personalise!
Custom cups: A beautiful piece of drinkware can make a lovely gift and is a great way
to ensure your guests remember your event for years to come. There are kits that allow
you to engrave names or images on glassware, but if your drinkware is disposable many
home craft supplies can be used! For example, painting the bottom of a glass with glue
and dipping in glitter can look very regal!
Garnish: A slice of lemon over the edge of a glass, a sprig of parsley, a delicate sprinkle
of edible flowers atop a punch bowl; garnish adds just that little extra something
to make a mocktail special. It can be as simple as a slice of lemon, or as complex as
perfectly arranged fruits on a wooden pick gently laid across the rim of the glass. 
83
Fancymaking: The Drinks
Lustre Dust: If you’re looking for a magical swirling shimmer, lustre dust is what you
need. Also known as pearl or sparkle dust, it is available in many supermarkets (make
sure to choose a brand labelled “edible”). Sprinkle a little inside your drink and watch it
shimmer and shine as you stir.
Sanding Sugar: This tasty decoration is simply large coloured sugar crystals, and can be
sprinkled on or inside mocktails to add texture and sparkle. You can often buy this next
to cake decorations – or make some yourself! There’s a recipe on page 74.
Treasure Icecubes: Ice is must for summer drinks, so why not make them more fun?
Freeze ice into shapes using silicone moulds, or try something a little more daring:
Freeze juice and cordials to add a bit of flavour and colour, or try making ice with edible
things inside: tiny flowers, berries, lustre dust or drops of food colouring!
Frozen or Floating Fruits: A few whole berries or pieces of fruit floating in your
mocktail adds a special touch. Freeze the fruits for an alternative to ice cubes that won’t
water down your drink!
Add a drop of colour: Great for making themed drinks, adding food colour allows you
to tint certain mocktails in exactly the colour you want. This works best in clearer or
light-coloured mocktails but can add a nice hint of colour to darker drinks as well. The
packaging of food colouring gives tips for mixing the colours you want. (Try adding a
drop to the bottom of your glass for a neat swirl when you pour!)
Delicious Drizzles: Using a syrup? Drizzle a little extra along the inside of your glass. It
adds interesting decoration and allows your guests to mix in some extra flavour.
Intriguing Additions: The more creative a mocktail, the better. As long as your
additions aren’t going to be a hazard, there’s no limit to what you could add! Lollipops
or popsicles will gently melt and add flavour – or can be taken out to enjoy on their
own. Slices of fruit or vegetables make a pretty snack, or celebrate the spooky season
by filling a syringe with a red syrup for your guests to inject. Get creative!

Methods
Boil | To heat a liquid to the point that it is bubbling and churning, and the bubbles
break the surface of the liquid.
Bruise | To partially crush an ingredient to help release the flavour. Use a spoon or
fingers.
Chill | To thoroughly cool something, but not to the point that it freezes.
Muddle | To crush or grind an ingredient to help release the flavour. Sometimes
crushed into salt or sugar. Use a spoon or a muddler.
Mull / Mulling | To add extra flavour to a drink by heating it with spices.
Rim (a glass) | To dip the edge of a glass into water, juice or syrup, and then dip
the wet glass into sugar or salt. For adding flavour and decoration.
Simmer | To heat a liquid to the point that it is moving, but no bubbles break the
surface.
Strain | Pouring a mixture through small holes, such as in a strainer or cheese cloth,
to separate solids from the liquid.
All mocktail recipes use standard cooking methods. The methods used in this book are:

The Serving Guide
Serving Guides
Every recipe in this book has a serving guide. The guide tells you how much sugar and
carbs the recipe contains, per serving. This is important for people who need to consider
their nutrition each time they eat or drink. The most common nutrient in drinks is
carbohydrates (carbs). Carbs are a macronutrient, meaning your body needs a lot of it.
Most people get enough carbs from their regular meals and don’t need to supplement
their intake.
How are the guides calculated?
To find how much sugar is in each ingredient:
1. Read the nutrition label or online to find “Sugars per 100g”.
2. Divide the “Sugars per 100g” by 100. Then, multiply that by the amount used in the
recipe. This number is your “Ingredient Sugar Total”.
(e.g There are 2.5g sugars per 100g of lemon. Divide that by 100. Multiply that new number by how much
lemon we are using: 60g. [2.5 ÷100 x 60 = 1.5]. This means 1.5g of sugar in 60g of lemon!)
To find how much sugar is in the whole recipe:
3. Add together all of the“ingredient sugar totals”. This number is the “Recipe Total”.
(e.g We are using three ingredients and we know their ingredient sugar totals: Lemon: 1.5, Apple: 2.5, and
Water: 0. Add those together. [1.5 + 2.5 + 0 = 4]. This means there is 4g sugar in the whole recipe!)
Find how much sugar is in the serving:
4. Divide your “Recipe Total” by the number of “Servings”.
(e.g. There are 24g sugars in the whole recipe. We divide that by the servings: 2. [24 ÷ 2 =12g]. This means
there are 12g sugars in the serving!)
Repeat steps 1 to 4 to find out how many carbs are in the ingredients, recipe and serving.
87
Each mocktail marked as ‘Low Sugar’ follows the guidelines set by Food Standards
Australia and New Zealand. There are separate guidelines for liquid and solid foods: for
our mocktails, we have used the liquid food guidelines.
Food Standards Australia and New Zealand define Low Sugar as:
• Liquid foods with no more than 2.5g per 100g
• Solid foods with no more than 5g per 100g
Are the ‘Low Sugar’ mocktails really low in sugar?
All sugars are carbs, but not all carbs are sugars. Carbs, or carbohydrates, is a term for
a type of biological molecule. The length of the molecule chain determines the type of
carb. Sugar and starch, for example, are both carb chains of different lengths.
To make things simple, we have followed the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand
guidelines. They define ‘sugar’ as one and two molecule chains, which includes table
sugar. Longer chains of three or more are defined as ‘carbs’.
We show both sugars and carbs because both are important for health, and some
carbs break down into sugars inside the body. Many people have health conditions that
require a careful watch on the amount of carbs and sugar they eat. Having information
about what you eat and drink allows you to make informed choices.
The serving guides can help you decide which mocktail to enjoy, and how much of it.
Someone who has eaten enough sugar that day might choose a low-sugar mocktail,
while someone who hasn’t eaten that day might choose a mocktail with more
sugar. The serving guides make sure that everyone has the information to decide for
themselves.
It’s all about making the very best choice for you and your body.
Why do you show Carbohydrates and Sugar separately?
Aren’t they the same thing?
