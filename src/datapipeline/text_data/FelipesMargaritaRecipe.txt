National Margarita Day is coming up on February 22nd, and we want you to celebrate with us!
In honor of this special day, we thought we would let you in on how we make our margaritas:
It all starts with the recipe. Ours stays true to the Felipe’s motto of “Fresh ingredients, Authentic recipes” by being simple and classic. We then fresh squeeze the key limes to make sure they’re extra zesty. Next, we mix the lime juice with only 100% blue agave tequila, orange liqueur, and simple syrup and shake every margarita to order.

Since margaritas are the most popular cocktail in the world, we know you have a lot of options. We also know that our margaritas are the freshest and most authentic you can find this side of the border. Why celebrate National Margarita Day with a mediocre drink when you can come to Felipe’s?
