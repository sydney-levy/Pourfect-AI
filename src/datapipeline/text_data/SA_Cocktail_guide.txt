About the Author
Kurt Schlechter started bartending in 1992 and has trained hundreds of bartenders in his hospitality
career. His passion for mixing drinks and his desire to be one of the best drink consultants in the industry
has taken him far and wide in the world of drinks.
He has worked for the Flair Bartenders Association for ten years where he competed in The Legends of
Bartending in Las Vegas and judged competitions in Florida and Dubai. He has guest judged competitions
in Europe and frequently trains bartenders around the world.
He was the co-founder of one of South Africa’s top bar schools; The Bartenders Workshop, but now runs
his own consultancy business “Corporate Cocktail Kings” where he specialises in bar ergonomics, cocktail
consultancy and customer service training.
Kurt won the World Margarita Cocktail Competition in Mexico in 2010, came second in the Angostura
Global Cocktail Challenge in Trinidad in 2011 and won the South African Brandy cocktail competition
in the FHM 2011. Humbly he claims to still be “a student of bartending” and loves nothing better than
mixing new creations!

As the demand for new tastes and flavours grow, so does the sale of quality mixed drinks.
These drinks we call cocktails are no longer just a generation of fruity parasoled sweet drinks, but some of
the freshest drinks and fl avours to be enjoyed in a bar.
All cocktail books have slightly different recipes, and sometimes this leads to confusion as to what the
correct recipe actually is. This book offers my knowledge of cocktails and the expertise of some of the
top bartenders I have had the privilege to meet on my travels. These mixed drinks have been tried and
tested by our customers and friends alike and I am sure you will enjoy them too.
The new wave of re-fashioned classics has arrived on our bar counters and, as bartenders learn that
there is no limit to taste, so our customers realise that cocktails are changing and evolving. Ingredients
are becoming fresher and more exotic. Those pre-mixed drinks you are able to buy in a bottle are not
as fresh as the ones we can mix in a glass.
The only rule of mixing drinks is that the taste should balance well in your glass and on your taste buds.
From lemongrass to ginger, mango to elderfl ower, black pepper to basil, anything goes.
Cocktails are about personal taste. Each of your guests will have their own preference. Use these
cocktails to satisfy individual needs. If you have this book at home or in a bar, you will learn that making
cocktails should not be a laborious task; on the contrary, a top cocktail bartender impresses his/her
guest with new fl avours and tastes and not the diffi culty of the recipe.
As price is always a factor when mixing drinks, I have tried to keep the cost of these cocktails down.
If you are selling these cocktails in your bar, cost each ingredient separately and then add your usual spirit
mark-up on the cost price. Remember, the true art of mixing drinks is to mix them at the same level
of quality and consistency every time. Beware of exotic ingredients that are expensive and not
always available.
From the classics to the contemporary, all these recipes have been inspired by generations of bartenders
who have made mixing drinks an art form. I hope this book encourages others to create their own
unforgettable drinks.

BARTENDING TERMS:
Drink making methods
BUILD:
Pour spirit/liqueurs and mixer over ice into a glass.
FLOAT / LAYER:
MEASURES:
STIR AND STRAIN:
Place ice and ingredients into
Boston glass. Stir with bar spoon,
mixing and chilling ingredients.
Strain ingredients with lid or a
hawthorn strainer.
As liqueurs, spirits and syrups have different
densities, it is important to pour the thickest or
heaviest ingredients first, for example, Grenadine
has a gravity of 1.18, whereas Southern Comfort has
a gravity of 0.97. Using a bar spoon, layer ingredients
on top of one another.
6.25ml = 1/4 shot
12.5ml = 1/2 shot
18.75ml = 2/3 shot
25ml = 1 shot
37.5ml = 1 1/2 shots
50ml = 2 shots
— PAGE 2 —
BLEND:
Using a muddle stick as the mortar and the glass
as the pestle, crush fruits and other ingredients to
release juices and essential oils.
Place ingredients into blender. Place scoop of
crushed ice or cubed ice and blend for a short
period. Finish by pouring contents into glass.
Fill mixing glass with ice, add ingredients as required
by the recipe and place Boston tin over mixing glass,
ensuring that it seales properly. Shake & strain with
a strainer. It also may be necessary to double strain
your drinks with a fi ne strainer.
MUDDLE:
SHAKE AND STRAIN:
— PAGE 3 —
AIRS
Whip fruit or vegetable juices with soy lecithin
using a hand blender.
BITTERS
The use of bitters is fast becoming a popular
ingredient in drinks again. Adding bitters gives
your drink a rich piquant flavour.
BLEND
This is done to macerate fruits, spirits and other
ingredients. Place in blender and blend for a
short while. Add more ice and blend for longer
to create “slush puppy” consistency. Use crushed
ice for a smoother drink.
BLUE AGAVE SYRUP MIX
Blue Agave syrup is a popular syrup to use to
give your drinks extra flavour, especially with
tequila based drinks. Blue Agave mix consists of
half water half blue agave syrup.
COCONUT CREAM
Mostly used in the Pina Colada cocktail.
Coconut cream may be bought in any major
supermarket. Most bars use flavoured rums
like Butlers Coconut in place of the cream,
as cream is expensive and has a two day
refrigeration life. It’s worth the effort if you
are making cocktails for a whole bunch
of people.
CHILL
To chill a glass, place one scoop of ice with water
into glass and stand for several seconds. Cocktails
that are not served with ice will get warm in a
matter of minutes. Chilling helps prevent this.
DASH
1/4 of a shot - about one teaspoon.
FINE STRAIN
It may be necessary to fine strain your
cocktails, especially when making drinks
with fresh fruits. This helps your drink from
turning into ‘thick cold soup’. You may want
to purchase a stainless steel tea strainer for
this purpose.
FLAME
Liqueurs and spirits have different alcohol
strengths. Some may flame more strongly than
others. Light flames away from customers or
flammable ingredients. Also be careful not to burn
yourself or your guest. The top of the glass may
be hot so be sure to inform your guest. To kill
a flame, place a cloth over the glass to stop the
oxygen supply to the flame.
FOAM
To make foam: place two egg whites in a 500ml
cream gun with gas and shake hard before using.
FREE POURING
Using a plastic or metal pour spout you can
accurately pour a 25ml shot using a counting
system. To achive this, one, two, three, four should
be counted a little faster than seconds. A four
count is a full shot, a three count is 3/4. A two
count is 1/2 and one is 1/4.
FROSTING
By placeing your cocktail glass or beer glass
in a freezer for more than an hour, a
thin film of ice will cover the glass. If you
have the space in your fridge this is a great way
to chill your glassware.
BARTENDER’S
DICTIONARY
— PAGE 4 —
GARNISH
For decorative purposes, a selection of fruits and
other ingredients can be placed on the rim of
the glass. This to enhances the taste, appearance
or aroma of a drink. Examples include lemons,
oranges, pineapples, maraschino cherries,
strawberries, bananas, kiwi’s and mint leaves. It
is important to note that not all cocktails have a
garnish and it is not necessary to build a whole
salad on the side of a drink.
GRENADINE
A red syrup made from pomegranates or red
berries. Slightly sweet, this syrup is mostly used
to colour drinks red, but may also be used as
a sweetener. The most popular cocktail is the
Tequila Sunrise with the grenadine giving the
sunrise effect.
HALF AND HALF
A pre-mix made before the start of a shift. Add
equal parts cream to milk. This can be used in
sweet cocktails that call for cream or milk.
HEAT A GLASS
To heat a glass simply rinse it with boiling water.
To keep a glass & its ingredients warm, place a
brandy balloon on top of a rocks glass filled with
boiling water.
LEMON JUICE
When making drinks it is important to use fresh
lemon or lime juice. This simple step will help you
improve the taste of your drinks dramatically.
ICE
Ice is one of the most important ingredients in
the bar. Always ensure that you have more than
enough ice when making cocktails as they may
easily run out. Never use the same ice twice when
making a cocktail.
Crushed ice may be made with a manual or
electric ice crusher. To crush ice by hand, wrap
cubed ice into a large bar towel and hit with large
muddler. Crushed ice is the most popular version
and is essential for any serious cocktail bar. You
can also use shaved ice from an ice shaver, but this
is not recommended as the drinks tend to “freeze
over” making them difficult to drink.
INFUSIONS
Bartenders have been infusing alcohol for over
a hundred years; in fact, sixty years ago it was
considered the norm for top cocktail bartenders
to infuse there own speciality spirits or liqueurs.
Infusion is a great way to add new flavours to your
mixing arsenal and also a great way to get some
of the most natural flavours into your cocktails.
You may choose to infuse spirits, but one of my
favourites, is infused syrups. Listed hereunder are
recipes for both.
Vanilla rum
Split two vanilla pods and place them in a bottle
of rum. Let stand for one to two weeks.
Lemon vodka
Grate the zest of two lemons and place them in
a bottle of vodka. Let stand for one to two weeks
and strain through a coffee filter (or fine strainer)
into a new bottle.
Lemongrass syrup
Blend one lemongrass stick with 750ml sugar
syrup. Strain through fine strainer & refrigerate.
MODECULAR MIXOLOGY
The gastronomically & scientific approach of
drink making that incorporates the use of gels,
powders, foams, sodas and atomised sprays. 
— PAGE 5 —
PURÉES
Purées are an essential ingredient in any modern
cocktail bar and although you cannot purchase
purées in unit containers in this country, you
may easily make them yourself. To purée any
fruit, simply place in a blender for a few seconds.
A good tip is to freeze seasonal fruits, defrosting
and puréeing as you need them.
RIM
To rim a glass, place 250 grams of sugar or salt in
a saucer and a splash of lime cordial in another
saucer. Dip the rim of the glass in lime and then
into sugar or salt. For a red rim, substitute lime
cordial with grenadine. To rim the glass with fruit
oils, rub a twist of lemon, orange or lime along
the rim of the glass.
SLICE
Lemon slices are the most popular garnish that
you may find in any bar today. This not only
refreshes the drink, but also adds a new taste
dimension to bland drinks.
TWIST/ZEST
Many drinks call for orange, lemon or lime twist.
Cut a 2cm wide peel, the length of the fruit, with
as little white pith as possible. Twist over drink.
This may also be called a zest.
TWIST FLAME
Used mostly for the Cosmopolitan cocktail. Heat
the peel side of the fruit for a few seconds. Then,
in one fluid action, squeeze the oils of the twist
over the flame of the lighter.
WEDGES
Lemon or lime wedges are important ingredients
that may enhance the taste or appearance of a
drink. Slice the caps at each side of the fruit and
discard; slice the fruit in half and turn vertically.
Now you will see that each wedge is in a natural
segment. Slice these evenly into wedges.
SOUR MIX
A pre-mix of half sugar syrup & half fresh lemon
juice, this mix is still used in many bars in South
Africa. Today top bartenders prefer not to mix
the two together as this enables us to use less or
more of the one Ingredient in a drink.
SPRINKLE
You may sprinkle or dust a cocktail with chocolate
powder, nutmeg or cinnamon should the recipe
require it.
SUGAR SYRUP
To make sugar syrup take 500grams of
castor sugar and blend with 250ml of boiling
water in blender. Place in clean sealable bottle
ready for use.
JUICE
It is important to buy the correct juice when
making drinks. For example buy real 100%
cranberry juice that is nice and dry and goes
well with the cosmopolitan. A lot of juice
suppliers mix their juices with other fruit to add
more sugars or simply to make the juice more
cost effective. Having quality juice makes a real
difference in your drinks.

“Dawa” is Swahili and means “medicine potion”. Named after the
fact that it changes fl avour as you drink it. The Secret to making
these drinks lies in the type of honey used. Creamed honey is, in
fact, raw honey and does not harden in your drink; it also has a
tasty caramel fl avour.

Drink Making Method
Step One
Pour Sambuca and Butlers Espresso liqueur into
Martini glass and wet all the sides. Light Martini
glass and ensure steady fl ame is burning.
Step Two
Ensure you have “Springbokkie” and cinnamon
sprinkles ready.
Step Three
Instruct guests to suck up the contents in the
Martini glass as quickly as possible. Ensure that
they do not put their faces directly over the glass.
They must suck as soon the straw is in the fl ame
otherwise the straw will melt.
Step Four
As the guest sucks through the straw, sprinkle
cinnamon over the fl ame. This will create an even
bigger fl ame. When the drink is just under halfway,
pour in the shot ensuring that everything is drunk
in one go. If it takes their breath away then you
have been successful.

Winter melon, spanspek and watermelon all work well with this
recipe. Vodka Martinis grew to popularity in the 80’s but, today,
basically any drink made in a Martini glass may be classifi ed
as a Martini.

History: In 1947, John Martin of Heublin & Co, the then owner
of Smirnoff, was pondering ways to encourage Americans to buy
his vodka, when his friend, Jack Morgan of the Cock ‘n Bull Saloon,
mentioned he had a large quantity of ginger beer. The resulting
cocktail was their idea, which sold like crazy. Smirnoff even sold this
mix in a copper coloured bottle of the same name. Today there are
 a few variations of the Mule. See Jamaican Mule on pg55.

Comment: The name of this drink means strained
pineapple and was invented around the mid 1900’s.
For a tasty variation, add two scoops of ice cream
to this recipe. Ensure you buy the coconut cream
and not coconut milk as the latter has less fl avour
than the former. Coconut cream only lasts
about two days after opening so try to
serve these as the cocktail of the day.
