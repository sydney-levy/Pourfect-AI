Another Day,
Another Mocktail :
Recipe eBook
Simple Syrup:
Some of the following recipes call for simple
syrup. You can purchase simple syrup
online or at your local grocery store, but it's
also really easy to make.
I make mine by dissolving equal parts sugar
in water (i.e. 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 c water). You
can do this on the stovetop by adding the
sugar to the water, heating, and stirring
gently until the sugar dissolves. However, I
think the easiest way to do it is to bring
water to a boil in a microwave-safe
measuring cup and immediately add the
sugar, stirring until it dissolves.
Then, pour into a jar with a lid and store in
the fridge to keep on hand for all of your
mocktail-making endeavors!

Cherry juice contains a plant chemical called anthocyanin.

in anthocyanin content it is.

Citrus fruits, such as lemons, are high in vitamin C. One lemon
(depending on size) contains about 50% of the recommended
dietary intake (RDI) of vitamin C! Vitamin C also helps with iron
absorption in the body, especially iron from plant-based foods.
Nutritional highlight:

juice into each
Top each glass with orange seltzer water (optional,
can leave out if you don't like bubbles)
Place a spoon against the inside edge of each glass
& pour about 1 Tbsp. grenadine down the back of
the spoon for each drink (goal: grenadine settles to
bottom of glass, giving the drink a "sunrise" look)
Remember, don't mix it!

you'd like to juice them yourself)

of orange slice. The pith (otherwise thrown away when juicing)
contains fiber that can aid in digestive regularity & gut health.

Blackberries, along with other darkly-colored fruits and veggies,
are known for their high antioxidant content. Blackberries are also
a great source of soluble fiber, which plays an important role in
digestion by increasing the bulk of stools and making them easier
to pass.
Nutritional highlight:
For the simple syrup, place 1/2 c water, 1/2 c sugar,
and 2 fresh sprigs of fresh rosemary in a small pot on
the stovetop
Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar is completely
dissolved. Leave the rosemary sprigs in the pan while
syrup cools to allow it more time to absorb the herbal
flavors
Once cooled, remove sprigs of rosemary and transfer
to a jar with a lid for storage. You will have enough
syrup to make a few drinks!

Grapefruit contains over 15 vitamins & minerals, making this a
particularly nutrient dense citrus fruit. Grapefruitâs nutrient, fluid,
and fiber content aid its ability to improve immune function &
digestion. Caution: grapefruit can negatively interact with certain
medications such as statins. Please avoid if you have been
advised to do so by your healthcare provider.

94% water by volume as well as several nutrients. Potassium,
magnesium, and phosphorus are among these nutrients and are
known as electrolytes. Electrolytes have numerous functions in
the body, including helping to keep us hydrated.
