Master Cocktail List
This spec sheet contains a mix of classic and modern classic cocktails presented in metric units. Every bartender has their
preferred way of making drinks, so I’ve tried to provide versions of each cocktail that work well internationally. I’ve also tried to
stick to simple glassware options that would be found in a good home bar setup.
When I used to train bartenders, I would encourage them to write notes about each drink as they made them – the taste,
smell, appearance, if it reminds them of anything and so on. You will find a notes field next to each drink for you to add your
notes and comments.
Check out Make Cocktails at Home to learn more about cocktail mixing methods, techniques and ingredients.
